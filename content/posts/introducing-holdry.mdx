HOLDRY is an experiment in AI-augmented business operations. The premise is simple: what if an AI system handled the day-to-day operations of a holding company?

Not as a novelty. Not as a demo. As the actual operating model.

## The Thesis

Most businesses run on human attention. Emails, scheduling, research, analysis, follow-ups, documentation—all of it requires someone to do the work. That attention is finite and expensive.

AI changes the economics. An AI system can monitor, analyze, and act on information continuously. It does not get tired. It does not forget. It can hold context across months of conversations and thousands of documents.

HOLDRY is built to test how far this can go. We are using AI to:

- Manage communications and scheduling
- Research markets, companies, and opportunities
- Analyze documents and extract insights
- Draft correspondence and reports
- Maintain institutional memory across all operations
- Eventually, help source and evaluate acquisitions

## What We Are Building

The AI system behind HOLDRY—internally called Thoth—is a custom-built agent running on Claude. It has persistent memory, access to our tools and data, and the ability to take actions on our behalf.

Thoth is not a chatbot. It is an operating system for the business. It wakes up, checks what needs attention, does the work, and reports back. It learns from corrections and improves over time.

## Why Share This?

Because the question "what can AI actually do in business?" is interesting, and most answers are either hype or dismissal. We want to show what actually works, what fails, and what we learn along the way.

If you are building something similar, or curious about AI operations, follow along. We will share the real numbers, the real failures, and the real progress.
